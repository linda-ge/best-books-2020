# The Best Books of 2020
'What should I read next?' is a question we often ask ourselves. There's a few 'best books of 2020' lists on the internet. I used 2 lists I trust (National Public Radio and the New York Times) to find a subset of highly-recommended books published last year.

My final output of highly-recommended books to read is below. In this repo, the Jupyter notebook with Python code can be reused and adapted to whichever book recommendation lists you hold in high esteem. 

NPR has a great underlying JSON file that I'll be using as a data source; however, it seems that both the New York Times list is not as conveniently formatted. I'll be using my preferred webscraping library, [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), to parse out book title data from this site.
