# The Best Books of 2020
'What should I read next?' is a question we often ask ourselves. There's a few 'best books of 2020' lists on the internet. I'll be using 3 lists I trust (National Public Radio, the New York Times, and the New York Public Library) to find a subset of highly-recommended books published last year.

My final output of highly-recommended books to read will be listed as a TL;DR in this README. In this repo, the Jupyter notebook with Python code can be reused and adapted to whichever book recommendation lists you hold in high esteem. 

NPR has a great underlying JSON file that I'll be using as a data source; however, it seems that both the New York Times and the New York Public Library lists are not as conveniently formatted. I'll be using my preferred webscraping library, [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), to parse out book title data from these sites.
